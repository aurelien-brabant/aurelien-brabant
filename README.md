- These days I'm working on my school project `ft_containers`, which is about recoding some containers from the C++'s standard library.
- I'm currently learning C++, TypeScript, React, NestJS and developing system administration skills.
- I'm actively developing [my website](https://aurelienbrabant.fr) and publishing some blog articles on it!
